            <p>Dearest Vedika,<br/>
                I hope you are doing well. Probably better than you imagined ever. I hope, and I believe you achieved all that you had in your mind, if it was right for you!<br/>
                I know how hard it might have been for you. Though you are so lucky, luckier than anyone else. You know why? God gave you the best of the world! The best parents, the best siblings, the best education, the best surroundings, and what not!<br/>
                And the greatest of them all, God gave you his support! You know and you have witnessed that numerous times, he is with you and in every action in every moment, he stands with you. He guides you to make you choose the right thing. What do you need more to prove this, huh? <br/>
                Hardships will come and go.  They say, “This too shall pass”. <br/>
                Don’t you ever crave for friendships. In oneness, there’s no loneliness, just peace and happiness (remember?)<br/>
                God knows what’s right for you and will send the right people your way, don’t you worry. You’re his dearest soul!<br/>
                And one more very important thing, don’t loose the child in you, NEVER!!! Its the only proof of you being alive. Just for some stupid idiots laughing at your actions, don’t lose it. They are unaware of your heart. The right ones will embrace the child cause they are aware of the love!<br/>
                Just be yourself, embrace the child within you, spread love and kindness, and shine brighter than the brightest!<br/>
                With Love<br/>
                Vedika!!</p>
